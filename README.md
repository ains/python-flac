python-flac
===========

This is (supposed to be) a pure Python C wrapper for [libFLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/).

I am aware of [pyflac](https://github.com/dsully/pyflac) now, but could not find it earlier.  
Since it is time for me to learn how the Python C API works, I thought it might be a good idea doing it this way.
